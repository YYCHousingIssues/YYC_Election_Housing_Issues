,No,,"This was a massive case of A didn't equal Z for me. The action wasn't going to produce the result that they all felt this would achieve. It was so clear, only if you were willing to open your eyes and look. ",Yes,,,"Repealing the bylaw is the easiest, especially now that the six-month window has passed all that is required is a majority vote. Prior to, a reconsideration of the bylaw would have been required, and this would have required 10 votes to overturn. There was nothing wrong with the RC-1 single family designation so no need to reinvent the wheel here. I will either bring for the Notice of Motion myself or sign on with the others that I know want to do the same. ",Yes,,,"See here is the kicker. The previous process of going before council to change your land use to multi was working just fine. The approval rate was 96.5%, with over 3% of those not approved coming back and getting approved with amended plans. If the past process only approved 50-60% then yes three was a problem with the process but there clearly wasn't. Sure it cost applicants money to do this but the amount of money that this is costing landowners in loss of property value impacted by applications, far surpasses that.   ",Yes,,,"But here would be my concerns with Plebiscites 1. Defining what is considered major could be a challenge, we can't afford to hold one every year. 2. Costs associated with plebiscites especially if they are done outside of a general election. The Olympic bid plebiscite back November of 2018 was held after the 2017 municipal election, this cost us 7 million to do, however it was estimated that adding it to the municipal election would have cost around $500 thousand. 3. I know in Ward 14, there was no reason to hold a plebiscite because it was crystal clear. 4. Then there is the validly of the results, non-binding so is a plebiscite no better than this type of survey if the Councilors don't plan to honor it. 5. As a councillor you are elected by the people to represent the people, some do and some don't. Perhaps there needs to be an amendment to the MGA that has a section that holds a councillor accountable for blatantly ignoring their constituents. ",I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,"Look, plain and simple here. Anything that will have a direct effect on the very fabric of a community needs to be done with a healthy collaboration of all impacted, be that directly or indirectly. This is what the Local Area Plan was designed to accomplish. Was it perfect no but it wasn't even given a chance. Take a few communities and have a health conversation over is re-identification and together come up with a vision. ",,No,,"Again, until council realizes that we are not the experts just the vessel for our citizens and that without engagement and collaboration then we are no better than a government dictatorship. Don't get me wrong uses like the ones you listed above are very important and need to be a focus on creating a healthy city, but you can't prioritize this by removing people right to express their opinions, be it for or against. ",Yes,,,"Prior to my 10 years serving ward 14 as community assistant, I spent a decade selling residential real estate, so I have knowledge in the housing market. The debate I had with the 9 councillors that pushed this was, ok if we are doing this to increase housing starts by removing perceived barriers and oversaturate the market so that pricing comes down, then what is the targeted price range or housing void? Is it 200 - 350, is it 400 - 550, is it 600 - 750 or what? See until we identify that targeted void and place parameters around filling that void then ANY new development will be done to best serve market demand. No small or large market developer is going to create product that cuts into their profit and frankly expecting them to do so is crazy. The only fundamental way to address affordable housing is by all three levels of government participating in some type of subsidy. Say for example we ask builder X who is building a 600 unit condo to make sure 10% is allocated for low-income housing, they simply will say no or find a way around it. Now if there was a subsidy or some type of financial adjustment offered for offering a $300,000 condo at let's say half for qualified low income buyers, then you would see way more of an uptick on getting positive steps forward in address this issue. To even imply that the rezoning was going to address or have any impact whatsoever on the housing market in Calgary was plain and simple magic bean nonsense. ",Yes,,,"100%, look Calgary is the third most investable city in Canada after Toronto and Vancouver. There are situations in Toronto where it's cheaper to leave the residential lot vacant, let the land value increase and simply pay the annual property tax than it is to do any type of community benefiting development. I heard a story of an investor selling one condo in Toronto then coming to Calgary and buying three and renting them all out at the same rental rates as down east. With out a proper foreign investment policy any stock, be it land only or new builds, these will never hit the intended market.  ",Yes,,,"Back to my previous comment, third most investable city in Canada. Without a policy around foreign investors why wouldn't they invest in Calgary, and to expect that this wouldn't have a direct impact on affordable rental opportunities in Calgary is simply not wanting to care. We will tell residents, hey your grass needs to be cut, hey you can't be pilling up landscaping bricks along the back of your house, but we don't even want to look at establishing parameters around rental rates? Just saying.",,No,,"So, I understand the question as it relates to the objective but here is what I will qualify. The very objective of the blanket rezoning was to allow for RCG style development in well-established single-family communities, so older communities. Older communities have seen population declines over the years but now are getting back to previous numbers. Now all new development already allows for this densification and infrastructure is required to supposedly accommodate this but that's a debate for another day. What I am getting at is older communities like the one I live in, Midnapore, were built with much larger infrastructure requirements, roadways, sidewalks, sanitation lines, etc. Fish Creek water treatment plant for example is running at 35% capacity, now that's by design because of its pending renovations but after that won't be any close to maximum capacity. The older infrastructure was built bigger and better so the question should be more is the city adequately budgeting or preparing for the replacement of this older infrastructure period. ",Yes,,,"but I will say that in my experience, especially in Ward 14 where we have a balance of older established communities and new ones. It's the new ones that lack everything highlighted in the background comment. Our new communities had limited transit because of the poor ridership model transit uses, they lack schools, lack emergency services and greenspaces that actually cater to mixed use. Our older communities have all of this, but I understand the context of this more pertaning to inner city older communities experiencing forced growth and densification. ",Yes,,,"As far as I know, there has never been a case where someone said, ""this is too much information"" so yes. ",,No,,"Ridiculous, this is the only comment I have for this. ",,No,,"The sooner we wrap our heads around the lack of efficient transit services and the fact that we are a winter city, the sooner we can pull our heads out of this ideology of no one uses cars anymore. ",,No,,"Here's why I said no. Currently Urban Forestry is underfunded and under managed. This is a work in progress but under the current popular replacement program for every popular tree removed they plan 5 more trees in the same community. This programs funding only allows for a limited amount of again popular to be removed. A notice of motion we supported by Andre will aim to increase the funding and focus on improving this. So, I guess what I am saying is, the urban forestry program has lots of room for improvement and more planting and with collaborations with our office we have identified several locations that can use more trees. Again, it comes down to funding, but we are headed in the right direction. ",,No,"Don't even try it. This city has plenty of underutilized real estate that is prime for densification, Anderson TOD as one example. ",Yes,,,,Yes,,,"but i think first of all we need to assess if we are properly using the green spaces we have now. For example, please stop making green spaces and just putting in one ball diamond and four soccer fields that never get used. Let make this space exciting, inviting and something that reflects how people interact with green space. Oh, while we are at it, we need to look at changing standards where we allow for crap dirt and grass seeding to be used, these only turn into acres of dandelions that multiply over and over, rendering the fields useless.  ",Yes,,,"but only if everyone is involved in creating these design standards. A robust conversation on what's durable for the Calgary climate, also each neighbourhood has its own characteristics. So, it's almost like if we have a Local Area Pland that took all these things into consideration, oh wait, we had one. ",Yes,,,"100% We do such a crap job of retaining our heritage and history, unless it's in areas that are headline worthy, but we cannot forget that the rest of the city also has history and heritage benefits. ",Yes,,,"Can never have enough conversations. Oh, and perhaps next time we can engage the Calgary Real Estate Board as last time I checked they have a good understanding and perhaps some valuable insight into the Calgary market. ",Yes,,,"Administration didn't even give it a chance. Was it perfect, no, but the last few questions on this survey could all form pillars on the LAP process. ",,,,"I am not answering this for no other reason than, city administration and 9 councillors forced the public to grasp at whatever so they could to save the character of their communities. Do restricted covenants accomplish this, I don't fully understand the legal parameters around these, but my understanding is that it will pit neighbours against neighbours and that's unfortunate. There was a process that was working and allowed for someone to apply for a change of use, and then the public had a chance to have their say. Allowing applicants to skirt around this through the direct control process is so shady. ",Yes,,,"Don't be sketchy, that being said, if there is a loophole, it needs to be closed. Plain and simple but that depends on who get voted in. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ward 14,Devin,Elkin,,,delkin@telus.net,"If elected as councillor for Ward 14 I will be bring forward a notice of motion that will prevent a repeat of the 7 day public hearing embarrassment that many of us witnessed and ensure that people feel heard. It reads as follows, ""There for be it resolved; in the event that a public hearing item garners more than two consecutive days of public hearing submissions, this will automatically trigger a pause in the file and a reengagement of those impacted, be it direct or indirect"". In the 10 years serving I can only recall a few, Rezoning, Floride, Olympic bid, currie barracks redevelopment but this will prevent the complete disregard we witnessed with the zoning public hearing. Thank you for putting this together. It was well done."

,No,,City Council did not listen to Calgarians and should have sought more collaborative and tailored solutions to the housing issue. ,Yes,,,,Yes,,,"Repealing this policy would open the door for land-use designations and Local Area Plans (LAPs) to be properly re-evaluated, including the option of returning to the previous zoning framework. This is a crucial step to ensure that future planning decisions reflect the real priorities of our communities, encourage responsible and balanced growth, and account for both infrastructure capacity and neighbourhood character. As a long-time community association board director, I witnessed first-hand how land-use redesignation applications and public hearings provided a necessary and valuable process for residents to have their voices heard.",,No,,Voters want plebiscites only when they think Council is ignoring their wishes.  It is far too late to hold a plebiscite on blanket rezoning in the upcoming election and the majority of the Calgarians do not want to live with this policy for another four years. We have heard residents loud and clear. I believe the new Council knows what Calgarians want.,I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,,,No,,,,No,,"Blanket rezoning in Calgary has not yet clearly resulted in reduced housing costs. While it has undeniably spurred more housing supply and eased development hurdles, the affordability benefits—both for buying and renting—remain unproven.    A targeted strategy will be more effective in creating affordable homes. By working with trusted non-profit housing providers, we can create homes that are truly within reach for those who need them most: young people, newcomers, single parents, the working poor, and seniors. These are the Calgarians being left behind by rising costs. Targeted investment in affordable housing will be more effective in helping ensure they have safe, stable places to live than with the current unfocused approach.",Yes,,,"Yes. I believe we need a certain level of mandatory inclusionary policy, particularly in areas where affordable housing makes the most sense—such as along transit corridors and near commercial areas. While I generally believe in letting the market dictate development, this is a case where we must ensure affordable mixed-income housing options are available.",Yes,,,"For those living near new multiplex builds, we’re already seeing issues like increased noise, excessive street parking, and a decline in neighbourhood quality of life. At the same time, people in existing affordable rentals are being pushed out because homeowners are being offered massive sums of money to sell, creating strong incentives for redevelopment. The result is that lower-income and long-standing residents are being squeezed out rather than supported, which is the opposite of what equitable development should look like.",,No,,"We see this first-hand in Ward 6. To ensure that growth is sustainable and does not outpace community needs, we must take a measured approach:    1) Develop where infrastructure already exists rather than forcing density into areas that cannot support it.    2) If densification is proposed, ensure proper infrastructure is in place first—including roads, transit, water, sewer, and emergency services.    3) Work with the Province to guarantee schools can accommodate increased enrollment, so children aren’t left in overcrowded classrooms or bused far outside their communities.    4) Ensure parks, recreation facilities, and green spaces are protected and expanded to maintain livability.    5) Prioritize funding for essential services like police, fire, and EMS so that response times and safety are not compromised.    Blanket upzoning ignored these critical considerations, and without proper planning, it risks putting additional strain on already stretched infrastructure and public services.",Yes,,,"Absolutely. In Ward 6, I am already seeing communities being heavily impacted by the blanket rezoning policy—inadequate road capacity, too few school spaces, loss of greenspace, or safety concerns in neighbourhoods where traffic has increased and exit points are limited. In my opinion, infrastructure should always match or exceed the planned development before moving ahead with any project. ",Yes,,,"This is smart, common-sense planning. Every proposed upzoning or major intensification project should be assessed to ensure that sewer, water, electrical systems, transit, roads, greenspace, and schools can handle the additional demand before moving forward.    Other cities already recognize the value of this approach such as Toronto, Vancouver and Portland.     Calgary should build on their experience. By requiring Infrastructure Capacity Reviews, we can prevent overloading existing systems, protect quality of life in our communities, and ensure development happens responsibly and sustainably.",,No,,"It is unrealistic to expect residents of any development, regardless of size, to make do with only 0.5 parking stalls per unit. This is bad policy that is already creating excessive numbers of cars parked on residential streets, and frustrating both new and long-standing residents. Calgary is a large, spread-out city where the majority of people rely on their vehicles to get to work, school, and everyday activities. In our cold climate, walking or cycling isn’t always practical or safe. Policies must reflect the reality of how Calgarians live, not force them into an unworkable standard.",,No,,"If given the choice developers may be tempted to eliminate on-site parking to lowers construction costs, but most Calgarians own a vehicle. Street parking should not be their only option.",Yes,,,"I believe protecting Calgary’s tree canopy must be a priority. Removing too many trees has serious ill-effects on our communities. It reduces natural shade and cooling, which worsens urban heat in the summer and increases energy use. It contributes to poorer air quality, since trees act as natural filters. It can also worsen drainage and flooding issues, as tree roots absorb large amounts of stormwater. Beyond environmental impacts, losing trees diminishes neighbourhood character, reduces property values, and harms overall livability. A healthy, well-maintained tree canopy is essential for both environmental resilience and quality of life in our city.",,No,"Greenspaces are vital to the physical health and wellness of our communities. Once lost, they are not easily replaced. They must be protected for now.",Yes,,,"In Ward 6, I’ve already seen several high-density developments remove beautiful Aspen areas and once these natural assets are gone, they are nearly impossible to replace. Vancouver has bylaws that mandate tree replacement when removals occur. Calgary should follow suit with balanced policies that respect property rights while ensuring long-term protection of our urban forest.",Yes,,,"These spaces are essential for kids to stay busy, active, and healthy, while giving them the opportunity to get outside for fresh air and unstructured play. Parks and recreation areas also strengthen community bonds, promote physical and mental well-being for all ages, and enhance the overall livability of our neighbourhoods. Protecting and expanding greenspaces is an investment.",Yes,,,"Infill developments should absolutely be subject to mandatory and enforceable design standards that respect the context and character of neighbouring homes and streets. Proper enforcement helps maintain the unique identity of each community — something we are already seeing tarnished under the current blanket rezoning policy. Without clear design standards, neighbourhood character is eroded and the sense of place that residents value is diminished. Thoughtful, well-regulated infills can add housing while still protecting the look, feel, and livability of our communities.",Yes,,,"As noted earlier, I support design standards that respect the character of neighbourhoods, which could include respect for heritage. Once a heritage building is gone, it cannot be replaced, so care must be taken in developing these areas.",Yes,,,"I support a planning approach that always includes the voices and input of the largest stakeholders in our communities — our community associations and residents. These are the people most directly impacted by growth, and their knowledge and perspectives are invaluable. Planning must also carefully consider infrastructure capacity and services, sustainability, and the local context to ensure that new housing is added in a way that strengthens neighbourhoods rather than overwhelms them. Meaningful community input leads to better decisions, greater trust, and development that truly reflects the needs and priorities of Calgarians.",Yes,,,"If the blanket rezoning policy is successfully repealed with a new City Council, then LAPs will also need to be paused and reviewed. I am in full support of this! Communities deserve a real voice in shaping their future, and it is only fair that planning documents reflect genuine consultation with community associations and residents.",Yes,,,"These covenants are legal agreements that residents and communities entered into with the expectation that they would help protect neighbourhood character, stability, and quality of life. Disregarding them undermines trust and creates uncertainty for homeowners.",Yes,,,"Special zoning, such as Direct Control districts, that circumvent restrictive covenants erodes respect and trust in City officials. Homeowners and communities rely on these covenants in good faith. Ignoring them undermines the integrity of the planning process. Respecting restrictive covenants is essential to maintaining transparency, accountability, and confidence in how our city grows.",,,,,,,Ward 6,,,,,,,,,Joanne,Birce,,,info@joannebirce.ca,"Thank you to for the opportunity to share my perspectives on housing policy issues that impact not only residents of Ward 6, but all Calgarians."

,No,,"After 9 months of campaigning, and meeting with residents across Ward 9, including developers, I can say that the general feeling is that this has had a negative impact on these communities. This is partly because genuine concerns from existing residents in these neighbourhoods have been ignored.    Cutting red tape, and bringing more housing online across the city is an appropriate thing to pursue.

Each neighbouhood in Ward 9 is a reflection of generations of people investing their lives in these neighbourhoods. In some cases multiple generations. We should be proactive in making sure that unique community character is reflecting in the planning and investments made in these neighbourhoods. With that said, Calgary is a growing urban centre, and we cannot ignore or avoid the obligation to meet that growth. ",,No,,I take issue with classifying rowhousing and addiction treatment centres as the same type of change in a neighbourhood. The introduction of social programming in a community is an important change that must be discussed and designed with community input.,,No,,"Across Ward 9 I've met with many folks struggling with housing affordability. We often think of it as young people not being able to find a place in these neighbourhoods - but it is also older people not being able to stay in their communities. I believe in a complete community concept, where the people who work at our favourite neighbourhood coffee shops and restaurants can also live in the neighbourhoods they serve. I believe in promoting ""gentle density"" measures that allow for laneway, carriage and secondary home suits to come online with priority so older folks are better positioned to age in place securely.     We see a number of successful cooperative housing projects built in the 1970s peppered across the city of Calgary in neighbourhoods like Sunnyside, Ramsay, Winston Heights. I would like to explore the application of this model today.     Finally, I believe we need to review the inventory of city owned lands across the Ward, and work with community partners who specialize in mixed-income and affordable housing to bring these projects online with efficiency. Uniquely in Ward 9, we see an integration of I-G legacy industrial lands that closely border historic neighbourhoods like Inglewood, Ramsay, Ogden and Dover. With the appropriate reclamation strategy, we may be able to increase the residential footprint of these existing, historic neighbourhoods.       ",Yes,,,"Doorknocking in the neighbourhoods of Ward 9, I have come across a number of empty, beautiful homes - some times multiple on a single block. These homes have gardens and streetscapes that look like they had been maintained up until last year. I was shocked at the number of empty houses I've come across. And I've talked with long term renters who are being evicted. I've also heard residents describe being ""harassed"" to sell their homes on multiple occasions.     Some of this is inherent to the process of re-development and growth. But it does feel like a very unbalanced relationship between development and the neighbourhoods being ""developed"".",,,,"Let's be fair - growth, density, and redevelopment all risk creating scenarios of pressure on existing residents in these neighbourhoods with or without this zoning policy.     We must actively participate in making sure that seniors, renters and low-income citizens have space in our communities. ",,No,,Ward 9 specifically has not been properly funded to keep up with the growing pressures of redevelopment. We have particularly old infrastructure in some cases. I am advocating for a fair share of investment in Ward 9. These old communities represent the oldest tax base in the city. It's time for those dollars to come home and be invested here so we are properly prepared to meet our growing population and demand. ,Yes,,,"Revising and/or phasing densification in these areas makes good sense to me. We have now all experienced what happens when catastrophic failure of a system like water occurs.     I would be particularly interested in seeing these assessments in Ward 9, where we have 100+ year old neighbourhoods. ",Yes,,,Where it is determined to be of great value to the decision process. I would hate to burden the calgary tax payer with another expense! ,,No,,"Many of the neighbourhoods in Ward 9 are desirable because of their proximity to civic amenities and downtown. If we are to invite more people into these communities, we must simultaneously invest in safe, alternative modes of transportation like public transit, cycling, walking and scooters.     I am well aware that Calgary is a driving city and that most people would agree that you *need* a car to live here. It is safe to say that we will never fully solve the parking problem in Calgary while simultaneously gaining in population and density without supporting alternative modes of transportation. At this rate, we may end up having to simply pave over a residential lot on each block, and designate it a parking lot.     Dark humour aside, each party must take its share of responsibility here. If you are introducing 4 or 8 new dwellings on a street, you must take responsibility for how those homes will engage with the block, including where they will park their vehicles. The City of Calgary, and council must take the responsibility of transportation and community connectivity seriously, planning and investing in it accordingly. ",,No,,"If you are building new dwellings on an existing street, you must take some responsibility for how it integrates into that community. This includes parking concerns. ",Yes,,,"Research and observation has already confirmed that this is the case. I have spoken with advocates in Renfrew and Bridgeland, which are two neighbourhoods that have been hit hard by an aging tree canopy and redevelopment. Bridgeland has been described as a ""hot zone"" meaning that it is hotter there than the surrounding areas because of loss of shading.    We must work to renew our canopy and to grow it. I have committed to doubling Ward 9's contribution to the city's existing strategy to growing our urban canopy. This means planting approximately 1000 trees across the Ward. A very feasible commitment. ",Yes,,Not all green spaces and parks of course. But in appropriate scenarios I don't think we should avoid exploring the idea. ,Yes,,,,Yes,,,"As our neighbourhoods grow and renew, we should take great care in providing space for residents to connect and build community. Parks, recreation and community centres are great places to build and strengthen those connections. ",Yes,,,"If you are walking into Ogden, Ramsay, Southview, Bridgeland, Inglewood or any of the neighbourhoods in Ward 9 you have to understand that you are stepping into an existing context. A context that is decades in the making. I think it is perfectly reasonable to say that if you are going to redevelop in these neighbourhoods, you need to work within that existing context.",Yes,,,"As it stands, Calgary does not have an effective or apropriate set of heritage policies that supports the maintenance or protection of our historic residential and commercial inventory. We must work to expand the city's heritage grants, support easy and efficient access to these funds for both commercial and residential applications. ",Yes,,,It's fair to say that the upcoming policy we have discussed today has not been as effective as perhaps originally intended. We should learn from these shortfalls and meet the challenges of our growing city collaboratively. ,,,Undecided,"As councillor for Ward 9, I would be happy to commit to reviewing the existing LAPs with those community parties who were involved in producing them - to review how these may need to be updated, or re-worked. ",,,Undecided,"In some cases yes, but let's make sure that these covenants hold the same meaning in the current version of this neighbourhood, as they did when they were put in place. Reviewing the relevance of these covenants in the present context of these communities is as important in this hypothetical scenario.

,No,,,Yes,,,I am committed to repealing the bylaw at the first opportunity of our new city council.,Yes,,,I support that residents know their communities best and should have a say in where and how neighbourhoods change and grow.,Yes,,,"Blanket rezoning was clearly a major decision — the longest public hearing in Calgary’s history proved it. With the majority of Calgarians who spoke and submitted written positions in opposition, residents sent a strong message. Council should listen to that level of input. If they won’t, Calgarians deserve the right to decide through a vote on changes this significant.",I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,I support that any council policy decision that excludes citizen engagement on matters as significant as blanket upzoning is bad policy.,,No,,"No, I do not support removing public hearings and appeal rights for these uses. Sensitive facilities like halfway houses and treatment centres can have very real impacts on surrounding neighbourhoods. The discretionary use process exists precisely to ensure residents and communities have a say before such major changes are approved. Reclassifying them as permitted uses strips away accountability and removes an important safeguard for both communities and the people who rely on these services. Public trust is already strained around planning decisions—this change would deepen that divide rather than build confidence.",,No,,"Blanket upzoning doesn’t make housing more affordable—it often fuels speculation and rising land costs. I support targeted strategies instead: building more non-market and purpose-built rental housing, incentivizing secondary suites and gentle density -- which create more affordable homes while respecting the character of existing neighborhoods.  Calgary needs real solutions, not one-size-fits-all zoning.",Yes,,,"Yes. Blanket upzoning often drives speculation and luxury / market rate builds instead of affordability. I support tying density increases to real public benefits—such as affordable units, family-sized housing, or community amenities—so that growth serves residents, not just developers.",Yes,,,"Rising land values and redevelopments do contribute to the displacement of lower-income or longstanding residents.  This is well documented in Vancouver and has been highlighted there recently with the approval of the West Broadway plan.  Seniors and other long term tenants are being forced out of older, well maintained, affordable units -- to be replaced by high rise, market rate apartments that are considerably smaller in square footage per unit. This is one point of many that reflect the broader impact of blanket upzoning.",,No,,The notion that the city will manage infrastructure concerns as they arise during the construction process is insufficient and causes unnecessary worry and stress to community residents.  We must not allow approval of heavy densification in established areas without a comprehensive study of the capacity of aged water and sewer as part of the application process.  Often overlooked is the over capacity of schools and limited greenspace in establised neighbourhoods to support more people.  Not to mention safety concerns of fire and EMS to quickly and safely arrive on site while navigating tight roads and narrow corridors.  I spoke to this issue directly at the WELAP Public Hearing. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,No,,"I do not support the blanket upzoning bylaw. Planning decisions that reshape our neighbourhoods should involve real consultation with residents, not a one-size-fits-all approach from City Hall. Communities like those in Ward 14 were built on the principle of stability and homeowner input, and residents deserve a voice in decisions that affect their streets, parking, traffic flow, and quality of life.    Upzoning may make sense in targeted areas where infrastructure, schools, and services can handle the growth, but forcing it across the entire city creates more problems than solutions.",Yes,,,"From the first day I have stated that I will advocate and vote for a full repeal of the blanket upzoning bylaw. My position is that communities should have a voice in shaping the character of their neighborhoods, and decisions on density and zoning should not be imposed city-wide without proper consultation. A repeal should restore the prior zoning framework (e.g., R-C1, R-C2) so that residents and community associations regain the ability to participate meaningfully in planning and land-use decisions. I believe in thoughtful, community-driven development that balances growth with respect for existing neighborhoods.",Yes,,,"I support repealing the blanket upzoning bylaw because it stripped residents of their right to have a say in what gets built in their neighborhoods. Restoring the previous land use districts, contextual rules, and the requirement for public hearings ensures that development respects community character, infrastructure capacity, and taxpayer priorities. Growth must happen, but it should be balanced, transparent, and accountable to residents not pushed through by City Hall without proper consultation",,,Undecided,"While Calgary’s Municipal Government Act does empower City Council to hold plebiscites non‑binding, community votes on significant policy shifts. I believe residents should have a stronger voice in planning decisions, but I am open to different tools, such as plebiscites, binding consultations, or stronger local engagement depending on the scale of the issue. Blanket rezoning, for example, was approved after weeks of the most substantial hearing in Calgary’s history, with nearly a thousand Calgarians participating. ",I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,"Prior to the blanket upzoning, residents had the opportunity to raise concerns and influence the shape of their communities through hearings and public input. Removing this process silences local voices and creates a one-size-fits-all approach that may not respect the uniqueness of each neighbourhood. I believe densification must be balanced with genuine consultation to protect community character, ensure infrastructure keeps pace, and build trust between City Hall and residents.",,No,,"While we must find balanced solutions to issues like addiction recovery, transitional housing, and housing diversity, residents deserve transparency and a say in how these facilities are placed in their communities. I support responsible development but with proper consultation, accountability, and safeguards for both community members and vulnerable populations.",,No,,"While the City of Calgary reports that since rezoning began in August 2024, development applications have surged with a 59% increase in applications for new housing in established areas in early 2025, this has not translated into lower housing costs.    I will prioritize infill only where it fits, focusing on neighbourhoods near transit corridors or areas already slated for redevelopment, rather than broad-brush giving every single-family zone blanket rezoning. ",Yes,,,"I agree that blanket upzoning can fuel speculation and drive up land values without addressing affordability. To prevent this, I would support:    Targeted zoning changes tied to actual community needs rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.    Affordability requirements such as inclusionary housing or mixed-income development that ensure new projects deliver real benefits for families, seniors, and first-time buyers.    Stronger community input before redevelopment approvals, so residents have a voice in shaping growth.",Yes,,,"While I support responsible growth and the need for more housing, I believe blanket upzoning, without careful planning can put pressure on long-standing families and lower-income residents. Rising land values and redevelopment can unintentionally drive people out of their own communities, and I think the City needs safeguards to protect affordability and stability while we plan for growth.",,No,,"I do not believe the City has adequately planned and budgeted for the infrastructure and public service demands that blanket upzoning would create. While the idea of increased density may have merits, growth without matching investments in roads, water and sewer systems, schools, emergency services, and transit will strain communities and reduce quality of life.    To ensure infrastructure and public services are aligned with future growth, I would support:    Phased growth planning tying density approvals to actual infrastructure upgrades, not promises.    Dedicated funding ensuring revenue from growth is reinvested back into the affected communities rather than spread too thin citywide.    Impact assessments requiring detailed studies on traffic, schools, utilities, and emergency services before major rezoning approvals.",Yes,,,"Growth must be responsible and not come at the expense of existing residents. If infrastructure and services are already strained, it makes sense to pause or phase in densification until those needs are addressed.",Yes,,,"Any decision on upzoning should be tied to clear data on whether local systems can handle the change. Infrastructure Capacity Reviews would ensure that we are not burdening communities with traffic gridlock, overloaded schools, or service disruptions.",,No,,Many families in Ward 14 and across Calgary rely on at least one vehicle per household often more. Cutting parking requirements too deeply creates spillover issues on neighborhood streets and frustrates residents. A balanced approach is needed that supports density near transit but still recognizes the real transportation needs of families.,,No,,"Eliminating on-site parking entirely shifts the burden onto existing communities and creates long-term problems with congestion, safety, and livability. Developers should not be given a free pass to ignore parking realities. Any changes must protect residents’ quality of life while promoting responsible development.",Yes,,,Growth in our city should not come at the expense of our trees and natural spaces. I believe we can expand housing in a balanced way while still protecting and planting more trees.,,No,"Parks and greenspaces are community assets. Redeveloping them into housing is short-sighted and undermines livability for families, seniors, and children.",Yes,,,I support incentives and practical policies that encourage tree planting and preservation.

Protecting our city’s history and character while supporting thoughtful growth is the best way to keep our neighbourhoods vibrant and livable for future generations.",Yes,,,"I believe growth in Calgary should be thoughtful, not one-size-fits-all. Blanket upzoning doesn’t always reflect the realities of infrastructure, schools, roads, and services in each community. I support a flexible planning approach that listens to residents, respects local context, and balances sustainability with livability so we can welcome growth while keeping communities strong.",Yes,,,"For me, planning must be community-driven, not imposed.

This can include a fund that can be allocated to the improvement of community centres for the delivery of better services and facilities to the community. ,Yes,,,"This is happening and is very concerning.

This issue has left many Calgarians feeling unheard and powerless, which only adds to the challenge of already low voter turnout. While few are opposed to growth, change, or development, proper engagement is essential if we want to continue building a world-class city, one that is not only dynamic and forward-looking, but also welcoming, supportive, and truly reflective of the people who call Calgary home.

I plan to be part of a sensible committee that takes into account all things when moving forward in approving anything to do with a redesign of our city. City Council needs to focus more on roads,property, design of communities pathway systems , so that we can get bike lanes back onto the pathway system for cyclist for their safety and all of ours.

I have researched this topic extensively and we have plotted 20,000 data points which clearly shows there are impacts to community safety.

One of my issues with blanket rezoning is it often means the removal of large trees which will take decades to regrow.

One example of my work on International Avenue was 300 trees being planted along 17th Avenue SE to put the Forest in Forest Lawn in the late 1990's.  With the reconstruction many of them would be destroyed.  I convinced Transportation Infrastructure a plan to relocate these trees (the Great Tree Move) to other parts of Calgary.

Nearly 70% of speakers and 88% of written submissions opposed the bylaw — a clear signal that residents did not support this policy. While I would prefer council to listen to that level of public input without requiring a plebiscite, I do believe Calgarians deserve the right to vote directly on significant city-wide planning changes if council continues to ignore the majority voice.",I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,"Growth must respect local character, infrastructure, and context, and that requires genuine consultation. Removing localized hearings through blanket upzoning was a mistake that undermined trust and silenced communities.",,No,,"Sensitive community uses and certain residential forms can have significant impacts on neighbourhoods, and residents deserve a meaningful voice in the process.

Blanket rezoning has primarily benefited developers and speculators, not residents looking for affordable housing.

To ensure development actually benefits residents, I would support the following measures:    Targeted, infrastructure-ready growth – Focus density near transit corridors, along major roads, and in underused commercial/industrial areas where services, utilities, and amenities can support it.    Protect existing affordable housing – Strengthen policies that discourage demolitions of naturally affordable homes.    Responsible development incentives – Offer faster permitting and reduced red tape for projects that deliver real affordability, family-friendly housing, or seniors housing—not just luxury infills.    Transparency and accountability – Require clear affordability outcomes in city-supported developments and ensure community consultation is part of the process.    Blanket rezoning is too blunt a tool—it hands benefits to speculators without guaranteeing affordability. We need a more thoughtful, targeted approach that balances growth with affordability and community stability.",Yes,,,"I have already seen examples of this happening in rezoned lots, where older, affordable homes are being torn down to make way for higher-priced developments.

I have already seen firsthand on recently rezoned lots that mature, beautiful trees are being torn down to make way for redevelopment. Calgary’s urban tree canopy is not only important for neighbourhood character, but also for cooling, air quality, and stormwater management.

Stronger protections, incentives to retain trees, and replacement requirements when removal is unavoidable should be part of any responsible development strategy.",Yes,,,"Yes, absolutely. Parks, playgrounds, and school fields are essential for healthy, livable communities. As Calgary grows, we need to protect existing greenspaces from being lost to overdevelopment while also ensuring that new communities are built with adequate parks and recreation areas.

Growth in established communities needs to be balanced with respect for neighbourhood character, privacy, and streetscapes. Right now, the non-binding guidelines are too easy to ignore, and we see new builds that overshadow existing homes or disrupt the feel of a street.",Yes,,,"Yes, I support requiring clear and enforceable heritage standards. Calgary’s established neighbourhoods have unique history, character, and architecture that should not be lost to one-size-fits-all development. Blanket upzoning risks erasing what makes these communities special. By putting enforceable heritage standards in place, we can accommodate growth while ensuring that new housing complements — rather than replaces — the history and identity of our neighbourhoods.",Yes,,,"Yes, I strongly support a more flexible and thoughtful planning approach. Blanket upzoning ignores infrastructure limits, strains services, and sidelines community voices. Instead, density should be added where it makes sense — near transit corridors, major roads, and underused commercial areas — with the proper infrastructure upgrades to support it. This way, we can grow sustainably while protecting greenspaces, respecting local context, and ensuring residents have a real say in shaping their communities.",Yes,,,"Yes, I support pausing and reviewing Local Area Plans. The current process has left many residents feeling that consultation was more of a formality than genuine engagement, with outcomes predetermined before communities had their say. That undermines trust in City Hall. We should return to a more open, transparent, and community-driven process — like the earlier ARPs — to ensure each neighbourhood has a real voice in shaping its future. Growth works best when it’s planned with communities, not imposed on them.",Yes,,,"Yes, the City should respect restrictive covenants when making planning decisions. These covenants are legally binding agreements under provincial law and reflect long-standing commitments that gave homeowners confidence when they chose their communities. Ignoring or bypassing them undermines trust and creates uncertainty for residents who expected those standards to be respected. The City must work within these covenants, not against them, to maintain fairness and consistency in planning decisions.",Yes,,,"Yes, the City should refrain from using Direct Control districts or other special zoning to override restrictive covenants. Doing so undermines both the legal standing of covenants and the trust residents place in the planning process.
