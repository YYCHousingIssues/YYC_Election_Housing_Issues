With the majority of Calgarians who spoke and submitted written positions in opposition, residents sent a strong message. Council should listen to that level of input. If they won’t, Calgarians deserve the right to decide through a vote on changes this significant.",I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,I support that any council policy decision that excludes citizen engagement on matters as significant as blanket upzoning is bad policy.,,No,,"No, I do not support removing public hearings and appeal rights for these uses. Sensitive facilities like halfway houses and treatment centres can have very real impacts on surrounding neighbourhoods. The discretionary use process exists precisely to ensure residents and communities have a say before such major changes are approved. Reclassifying them as permitted uses strips away accountability and removes an important safeguard for both communities and the people who rely on these services.

",Yes,,,"Repealing this policy would open the door for land-use designations and Local Area Plans (LAPs) to be properly re-evaluated, including the option of returning to the previous zoning framework. This is a crucial step to ensure that future planning decisions reflect the real priorities of our communities, encourage responsible and balanced growth, and account for both infrastructure capacity and neighbourhood character. As a long-time community association board director, I witnessed first-hand how land-use redesignation applications and public hearings provided a necessary and valuable process for residents to have their voices heard.",Yes,,,"Yes. I believe Calgarians should have the right to vote directly by plebiscite on major city-wide planning decisions such as blanket upzoning. However, the most efficient and cost-effective way to do this would be to hold plebiscites during municipal elections, when voter turnout is highest and additional costs can be minimized. BUT, it is far too late to hold a plebiscite on blanket rezoning for the upcoming election and the majority of the electorate will not want to live with this policy for another four years.",I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,,,No,,"I do not support removing public hearings or limiting appeal rights by reclassifying discretionary uses as permitted uses. I believe community associations and residents must always have the opportunity to provide input and voice their concerns on any and all applications that affect their neighbourhoods. Public engagement is a vital part of building trust, ensuring accountability, and making sure developments align with the needs and character of each community.",,No,,"Blanket rezoning in Calgary has not yet clearly resulted in reduced housing costs. While it has undeniably spurred more housing supply and eased development hurdles, the affordability benefits—both for buying and renting—remain tentative and still unfolding.    By working with trusted non-profit housing providers, we can create homes that are truly within reach for those who need them most: young people, newcomers, single parents, the working poor, and seniors. These are the Calgarians being left behind by rising costs, and targeted investment in affordable housing will help ensure they have safe, stable places to live. I will push for stronger federal funding for Calgary so the City of Calgary can partner with non-profits to build real, impactful affordable housing. ",Yes,,,"Yes. I believe we need a certain level of mandatory inclusionary policy, particularly in areas where affordable housing makes the most sense—such as along transit corridors and under-used commercial areas. While I generally believe in letting the market dictate development, this is a case where we must step in to ensure affordable mixed-income housing options are available for those who need them most. By requiring affordability in targeted areas, we can balance growth while ensuring equitable development that benefits those who need it most—not just speculators or developers.",Yes,,,"Yes. I am concerned that Calgary’s blanket upzoning is creating real pressures that contribute to displacement. For those living near new multiplex builds, we’re already seeing issues like increased noise, excessive street parking, and a decline in neighbourhood quality of life. At the same time, people in existing affordable rentals are being pushed out because homeowners are being offered massive sums of money to sell, creating strong incentives for redevelopment. The result is that lower-income and long-standing residents are being squeezed out rather than supported, which is the opposite of what equitable development should look like.",,No,,"No. I do not believe the City of Calgary has adequately planned or budgeted for the infrastructure and public service demands created by blanket upzoning - we are seeing this first-hand in Ward 6. To ensure that growth is sustainable and does not outpace community needs, we must take a measured approach:    1) Develop where infrastructure already exists rather than forcing density into areas that cannot support it.    2) If densification is proposed, ensure proper infrastructure is in place first—including roads, transit, water, sewer, and emergency services.    3) Work with the Province to guarantee schools can accommodate increased enrollment, so children aren’t left in overcrowded classrooms or bused far outside their communities.    4) Ensure parks, recreation facilities, and green spaces are protected and expanded to maintain livability.    5) Prioritize funding for essential services like police, fire, and EMS so that response times and safety are not compromised.    Blanket upzoning ignored these critical considerations, and without proper planning, it risks putting additional strain on already stretched infrastructure and public services.",Yes,,,"Absolutely. I would be in favour of pausing, revising, or phasing densification in areas where infrastructure or public services are lacking. In my own Ward 6, I am already seeing communities being heavily impacted by the blanket rezoning policy—inadequate road capacity, too few school spaces, loss of greenspace, or safety concerns in neighbourhoods where traffic has increased and exit points are limited. In my opinion, infrastructure should always match or exceed the planned development before moving ahead with any project. Growth must be responsible, sustainable, and community-focused, not rushed at the expense of livability and safety.",Yes,,,"Yes. I would absolutely support Infrastructure Capacity Reviews as part of the Development Review Process. This is smart, common-sense planning. Every proposed upzoning or major intensification project should be assessed to ensure that sewer, water, electrical systems, transit, roads, greenspace, and schools can handle the additional demand before moving forward.    Other cities already recognize the value of this approach. For example, Toronto includes “Infrastructure Capacity Assessments” in its planning process to ensure that growth corridors have adequate water, sewer, and transit services before development proceeds. Vancouver conducts “servicing studies” for large redevelopments to evaluate whether utilities and roads can support added density. Even U.S. cities like Portland require transportation and infrastructure impact analyses as part of their zoning and land-use review.    Calgary should be no different. By requiring Infrastructure Capacity Reviews, we can prevent overloading existing systems, protect quality of life in our communities, and ensure development happens responsibly and sustainably.",,No,,"It is unrealistic to expect residents of any development, regardless of size, to make do with only 0.5 parking stalls per unit. This is an example of bad policy that is already creating excessive amounts of cars parked on residential streets, frustrating both new and long-standing residents. Calgary is a large, spread-out city where the majority of people rely on their vehicles to get to work, school, and everyday activities. In our cold climate, where walking or cycling isn’t always practical or safe, expecting families to go without adequate parking feels like social engineering rather than sound planning. Policies must reflect the reality of how Calgarians live, not force them into an unworkable standard.",,No,,I do not support eliminating on-site parking requirements for residential developments in Calgary. If given the choice developers would be tempted to eliminate on-site parking to lowers construction costs.,Yes,,,"I believe protecting Calgary’s tree canopy must remain a priority. Removing too many trees has serious ill-effects on our communities. It reduces natural shade and cooling, which worsens urban heat in the summer and increases energy use. It contributes to poorer air quality, since trees act as natural filters. It can also worsen drainage and flooding issues, as tree roots absorb large amounts of stormwater. Beyond environmental impacts, losing trees diminishes neighbourhood character, reduces property values, and harms overall livability. A healthy, well-maintained tree canopy is essential for both environmental resilience and quality of life in our city.",,No,"I do not support the redevelopment of greenspaces and parks into residential development. Greenspaces are vital to the physical health and wellness of our communities, providing places for exercise, recreation, and connection with nature. Once lost, they are not easily be replaced, which is why they must be protected for current and future generations.",Yes,,,"I would support policies that protect and enhance Calgary’s urban tree canopy on private lands. In Ward 6, I’ve already seen several high-density developments remove beautiful Aspen areas, and once these natural assets are gone, they are nearly impossible to replace. Vancouver has bylaws that mandate tree replacement when removals occur. Calgary should follow suit with balanced policies that respect property rights while ensuring long-term protection of our urban forest.",Yes,,,"I would support policies to preserve and expand greenspaces — including parks, school playing fields, and community playgrounds — in both established and new communities. These spaces are essential for kids to stay busy, active, and healthy, while giving them the opportunity to get outside for fresh air and unstructured play. Parks and recreation areas also strengthen community bonds, promote physical and mental well-being for all ages, and enhance the overall livability of our neighbourhoods. Protecting and expanding greenspaces is an investment",Yes,,,"Infill developments should absolutely be subject to mandatory and enforceable design standards that respect the context and character of neighbouring homes and streets. Proper enforcement helps maintain the unique identity of each community — something we are already seeing tarnished under the current blanket rezoning policy. Without clear design standards, neighbourhood character is eroded and the sense of place that residents value is diminished. Thoughtful, well-regulated infills can add housing while still protecting the look, feel, and livability of our communities.",Yes,,,"Many cities in Canada and abroad have clear and enforceable heritage standards that developers must follow when building or redeveloping in established neighbourhoods. These policies are designed to balance growth with the preservation of community character and history.    Calgary has already lost far too many of our heritage buildings, and with them, important parts of our city’s story and identity. Once heritage is gone, it cannot be replaced, which is why stronger protections and thoughtful planning are essential moving forward.",Yes,,,"I support a more flexible planning approach, but development must always include the voices and input of the largest stakeholders in our communities — our community associations and residents. These are the people most directly impacted by growth, and their knowledge and perspectives are invaluable. Planning must also carefully consider infrastructure capacity and services, sustainability, and the local context to ensure that new housing is added in a way that strengthens neighbourhoods rather than overwhelming them. Meaningful community input leads to better decisions, greater trust, and development that truly reflects the needs and priorities of Calgarians.",Yes,,,"If the blanket rezoning policy is successfully repealed with a new City Council, then LAPs will also need to be paused and reviewed. I am in full support of this! Communities deserve a real voice in shaping their future, and it is only fair that planning documents reflect genuine consultation with community associations and residents.",Yes,,,"The City of Calgary should respect restrictive covenants when making planning decisions, even if zoning bylaws might otherwise allow different uses. These covenants are legal agreements that residents and communities entered into with the expectation that they would help protect neighbourhood character, stability, and quality of life. Disregarding them undermines trust and creates uncertainty for homeowners. By respecting these covenants, the City can ensure that development is carried out responsibly and in keeping with the commitments and expectations that shaped these communities.",Yes,,,"The City should not use special zoning, such as Direct Control districts, to override or circumvent restrictive covenants. Doing so only erodes respect and trust in City administration and elected officials. Homeowners and communities rely on these covenants in good faith, and ignoring them undermines the integrity of the planning process. Respecting restrictive covenants is essential to maintaining transparency, accountability, and confidence in how our city grows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Planning decisions that reshape our neighbourhoods should involve real consultation with residents, not a one-size-fits-all approach from City Hall. Communities like those in Ward 14 were built on the principle of stability and homeowner input, and residents deserve a voice in decisions that affect their streets, parking, traffic flow, and quality of life.    Upzoning may make sense in targeted areas where infrastructure, schools, and services can handle the growth, but forcing it across the entire city creates more problems than solutions.",Yes,,,"From the first day I have stated that I will advocate and vote for a full repeal of the blanket upzoning bylaw. My position is that communities should have a voice in shaping the character of their neighborhoods, and decisions on density and zoning should not be imposed city-wide without proper consultation. A repeal should restore the prior zoning framework (e.g., R-C1, R-C2) so that residents and community associations regain the ability to participate meaningfully in planning and land-use decisions. I believe in thoughtful, community-driven development that balances growth with respect for existing neighborhoods.",Yes,,,"I support repealing the blanket upzoning bylaw because it stripped residents of their right to have a say in what gets built in their neighborhoods. Restoring the previous land use districts, contextual rules, and the requirement for public hearings ensures that development respects community character, infrastructure capacity, and taxpayer priorities. Growth must happen, but it should be balanced, transparent, and accountable to residents not pushed through by City Hall without proper consultation",,,Undecided,"While Calgary’s Municipal Government Act does empower City Council to hold plebiscites non‑binding, community votes on significant policy shifts. I believe residents should have a stronger voice in planning decisions, but I am open to different tools, such as plebiscites, binding consultations, or stronger local engagement depending on the scale of the issue. Blanket rezoning, for example, was approved after weeks of the most substantial hearing in Calgary’s history, with nearly a thousand Calgarians participating. ",I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,"Prior to the blanket upzoning, residents had the opportunity to raise concerns and influence the shape of their communities through hearings and public input. Removing this process silences local voices and creates a one-size-fits-all approach that may not respect the uniqueness of each neighbourhood. I believe densification must be balanced with genuine consultation to protect community character, ensure infrastructure keeps pace, and build trust between City Hall and residents.",,No,,"While we must find balanced solutions to issues like addiction recovery, transitional housing, and housing diversity, residents deserve transparency and a say in how these facilities are placed in their communities. I support responsible development but with proper consultation, accountability, and safeguards for both community members and vulnerable populations.",,No,,"While the City of Calgary reports that since rezoning began in August 2024, development applications have surged with a 59% increase in applications for new housing in established areas in early 2025, this has not translated into lower housing costs.    I will prioritize infill only where it fits, focusing on neighbourhoods near transit corridors or areas already slated for redevelopment, rather than broad-brush giving every single-family zone blanket rezoning. ",Yes,,,"I agree that blanket upzoning can fuel speculation and drive up land values without addressing affordability. To prevent this, I would support:    Targeted zoning changes tied to actual community needs rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.    Affordability requirements such as inclusionary housing or mixed-income development that ensure new projects deliver real benefits for families, seniors, and first-time buyers.    Stronger community input before redevelopment approvals, so residents have a voice in shaping growth.",Yes,,,"While I support responsible growth and the need for more housing, I believe blanket upzoning, without careful planning can put pressure on long-standing families and lower-income residents. Rising land values and redevelopment can unintentionally drive people out of their own communities, and I think the City needs safeguards to protect affordability and stability while we plan for growth.",,No,,"I do not believe the City has adequately planned and budgeted for the infrastructure and public service demands that blanket upzoning would create. While the idea of increased density may have merits, growth without matching investments in roads, water and sewer systems, schools, emergency services, and transit will strain communities and reduce quality of life.    To ensure infrastructure and public services are aligned with future growth, I would support:    Phased growth planning tying density approvals to actual infrastructure upgrades, not promises.    Dedicated funding ensuring revenue from growth is reinvested back into the affected communities rather than spread too thin citywide.    Impact assessments requiring detailed studies on traffic, schools, utilities, and emergency services before major rezoning approvals.",Yes,,,"Growth must be responsible and not come at the expense of existing residents. If infrastructure and services are already strained, it makes sense to pause or phase in densification until those needs are addressed.",Yes,,,"Any decision on upzoning should be tied to clear data on whether local systems can handle the change. Infrastructure Capacity Reviews would ensure that we are not burdening communities with traffic gridlock, overloaded schools, or service disruptions.",,No,,Many families in Ward 14 and across Calgary rely on at least one vehicle per household often more. Cutting parking requirements too deeply creates spillover issues on neighborhood streets and frustrates residents. A balanced approach is needed that supports density near transit but still recognizes the real transportation needs of families.,,No,,"Eliminating on-site parking entirely shifts the burden onto existing communities and creates long-term problems with congestion, safety, and livability. Developers should not be given a free pass to ignore parking realities. Any changes must protect residents’ quality of life while promoting responsible development.",Yes,,,Growth in our city should not come at the expense of our trees and natural spaces. I believe we can expand housing in a balanced way while still protecting and planting more trees.,,No,"Parks and greenspaces are community assets. Redeveloping them into housing is short-sighted and undermines livability for families, seniors, and children.",Yes,,,I support incentives and practical policies that encourage tree planting and preservation. This can be done in a way that respects private property rights while strengthening our shared environment.,Yes,,,"Strong communities need safe and accessible greenspaces. I support working with developers, schools, and community associations to ensure that new communities have proper greenspace and that existing neighborhoods maintain theirs.",Yes,,,"Infill development is important for adding housing options, but it should not come at the expense of the character and integrity of established neighbourhoods. Enforceable standards would ensure that new builds respect setbacks, scale, and streetscapes, preserving the balance between growth and community identity.",Yes,,,"As councillor, I would work to ensure that development policies respect both community heritage and the pressing need for housing. Protecting our city’s history and character while supporting thoughtful growth is the best way to keep our neighbourhoods vibrant and livable for future generations.",Yes,,,"I believe growth in Calgary should be thoughtful, not one-size-fits-all. Blanket upzoning doesn’t always reflect the realities of infrastructure, schools, roads, and services in each community. I support a flexible planning approach that listens to residents, respects local context, and balances sustainability with livability so we can welcome growth while keeping communities strong.",Yes,,,"For me, planning must be community-driven, not imposed. Local voices matter, and I would work to restore a process that listens first, acts second, and delivers plans that reflect the needs and values of the people who live there.",Yes,,,Restrictive covenants should be respected when making planning decisions.

I have walked in streets where I could see in one block all type of developments, including traditional single houses, duplexes, four plexes, and other larger developments with different designs, including some with 4 mini entrances with door bells side by side at Main Street. ",Yes,,,"We need to keep the character and essence of Calgary and our neighbourhoods. Developers need to have some guidelines and regulations that provide them with a good sense of how to build in a sustainable way that respects the character of our city and integrates our essenc into their developments.

This can include a fund that can be allocated to the improvement of community centres for the delivery of better services and facilities to the community. ,Yes,,,"This is happening and is very concerning. I have talked to some neighbours that have not developed their houses, and that right now are surrounded by new developments.

While I would prefer council to listen to that level of public input without requiring a plebiscite, I do believe Calgarians deserve the right to vote directly on significant city-wide planning changes if council continues to ignore the majority voice.",I believe that local communities and directly affected residents should have a meaningful and guaranteed voice in shaping how development occurs in their neighbourhoods to ensure densification respects local character and context.,,"Growth must respect local character, infrastructure, and context, and that requires genuine consultation.

To ensure development actually benefits residents, I would support the following measures:    Targeted, infrastructure-ready growth – Focus density near transit corridors, along major roads, and in underused commercial/industrial areas where services, utilities, and amenities can support it.    Protect existing affordable housing – Strengthen policies that discourage demolitions of naturally affordable homes.    Responsible development incentives – Offer faster permitting and reduced red tape for projects that deliver real affordability, family-friendly housing, or seniors housing—not just luxury infills.    Transparency and accountability – Require clear affordability outcomes in city-supported developments and ensure community consultation is part of the process.    Blanket rezoning is too blunt a tool—it hands benefits to speculators without guaranteeing affordability. We need a more thoughtful, targeted approach that balances growth with affordability and community stability.",Yes,,,"I have already seen examples of this happening in rezoned lots, where older, affordable homes are being torn down to make way for higher-priced developments. Growth should be planned carefully to protect existing communities, preserve affordability, and ensure residents are not forced out of their neighbourhoods.",,No,,"Calgary still loses roughly 20% of its water supply due to leaks, and other core systems like roads, sewer, and transit are already under pressure. Increasing density without addressing these critical infrastructure needs only compounds the problem and risks reducing service reliability for existing and new residents alike.",Yes,,,"Growth should never outpace the capacity of water, sewer, transit, roads, schools, or emergency services. Phased or targeted development ensures that neighbourhoods can handle increased density without compromising service reliability or quality of life for existing residents. Responsible planning means matching density to infrastructure readiness, not imposing it uniformly across the city.",Yes,,,"Any proposed upzoning or major intensification should be evaluated to ensure that sewer, water, electrical, transit, roads, greenspace, and schools can handle the increased demand. This ensures growth is sustainable, protects service quality for existing residents, and prevents costly surprises from overburdened infrastructure.",,No,,"Most Calgarians still rely on vehicles for work, family responsibilities, and daily life. Cutting parking requirements this drastically would push cars onto streets, create congestion, and negatively impact neighbourhood livability. New developments need realistic parking solutions that reflect how residents actually live today, while still encouraging transit and active transportation where practical.",,No,,"No, I do not support eliminating on-site parking requirements. Calgary is still a city where most residents rely on their vehicles for work, family responsibilities, and daily life. Removing parking minimums without ensuring adequate alternatives only pushes cars onto already crowded streets, creating conflict and safety concerns in established communities. I believe new developments should include realistic parking solutions that reflect how Calgarians actually live today, while still encouraging transit use and active transportation where practical.",Yes,,,"Yes, I am very concerned. I have already seen firsthand on recently rezoned lots that mature, beautiful trees are being torn down to make way for redevelopment. Calgary’s urban tree canopy is not only important for neighbourhood character, but also for cooling, air quality, and stormwater management. Blanket upzoning accelerates this loss by prioritizing lot coverage over environmental and community value. We need stronger protections for existing trees and planning policies that balance development with preserving our natural assets.",,No,"When I ran in 2021, I ended our final debate by stating that I would never sell a greenspace in Ward 11 to a developer, and I stand by that today. Parks, playgrounds, and community greenspaces are essential for healthy, livable neighbourhoods, and should be preserved for residents rather than converted into housing.",Yes,,,"Mature trees are vital for neighbourhood character, air quality, cooling, stormwater management, and overall quality of life. Stronger protections, incentives to retain trees, and replacement requirements when removal is unavoidable should be part of any responsible development strategy.",Yes,,,"Yes, absolutely. Parks, playgrounds, and school fields are essential for healthy, livable communities. As Calgary grows, we need to protect existing greenspaces from being lost to overdevelopment while also ensuring that new communities are built with adequate parks and recreation areas. These spaces support families, active living, mental health, and community connection — they are not optional, they are core infrastructure.",Yes,,,"Yes, I believe infill developments should be subject to mandatory and enforceable design standards. Growth in established communities needs to be balanced with respect for neighbourhood character, privacy, and streetscapes. Right now, the non-binding guidelines are too easy to ignore, and we see new builds that overshadow existing homes or disrupt the feel of a street.",Yes,,,"Yes, I support requiring clear and enforceable heritage standards. Calgary’s established neighbourhoods have unique history, character, and architecture that should not be lost to one-size-fits-all development. Blanket upzoning risks erasing what makes these communities special. By putting enforceable heritage standards in place, we can accommodate growth while ensuring that new housing complements — rather than replaces — the history and identity of our neighbourhoods.",Yes,,,"Yes, I strongly support a more flexible and thoughtful planning approach. Blanket upzoning ignores infrastructure limits, strains services, and sidelines community voices. Instead, density should be added where it makes sense — near transit corridors, major roads, and underused commercial areas — with the proper infrastructure upgrades to support it. This way, we can grow sustainably while protecting greenspaces, respecting local context, and ensuring residents have a real say in shaping their communities.",Yes,,,"Yes, I support pausing and reviewing Local Area Plans. The current process has left many residents feeling that consultation was more of a formality than genuine engagement, with outcomes predetermined before communities had their say. That undermines trust in City Hall. We should return to a more open, transparent, and community-driven process — like the earlier ARPs — to ensure each neighbourhood has a real voice in shaping its future. Growth works best when it’s planned with communities, not imposed on them.",Yes,,,"Yes, the City should respect restrictive covenants when making planning decisions. These covenants are legally binding agreements under provincial law and reflect long-standing commitments that gave homeowners confidence when they chose their communities. Ignoring or bypassing them undermines trust and creates uncertainty for residents who expected those standards to be respected. The City must work within these covenants, not against them, to maintain fairness and consistency in planning decisions.",Yes,,,"Yes, the City should refrain from using Direct Control districts or other special zoning to override restrictive covenants. Doing so undermines both the legal standing of covenants and the trust residents place in the planning process. If changes are ever needed, they should come from the affected homeowners themselves — not be imposed unilaterally by City Hall.",,,,,,,,,,,,Ward 11,,,,Rob,Ward,,,info@robward11.ca,"Thank you for the opportunity to share my views. I believe Calgary needs thoughtful, community-driven growth — not one-size-fits-all blanket rezoning that ignores infrastructure limits, displaces affordable homes, and erodes neighbourhood character. I am committed to restoring genuine public engagement, protecting our tree canopy and greenspaces, and ensuring development benefits residents first, not speculators. My focus will always be on practical, balanced solutions that respect communities while planning responsibly for the future."
